# Spencer Haugh - A Portfolio Site

## Project setup

Welcome to my portfolio site! 

I built this site using Vue.js, and as I have only learned Vue in the last few days Ithink it came out pretty great! 

You'll see from my portfolio that I am able to build sites with several other methods, like React for example. I chose to use Vue due to it's lightweight nature, and to better familiarize myself with the platform.

This is a living site, so expect to see updates here as I learn and implement new skills, as well as complete more great projects to add to it!

Thank you,
Spencer
