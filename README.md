# Spencer Haugh - A Portfolio Site

## Project setup

Welcome to my portfolio site! 

I built this site using Vue.js, at the time of build I had only just learned Vue in the past few days, but I think it came out pretty great! I absolutely welcome any feedback.

You'll see from my projects portfolio that I am able to build sites with several other methods as well, like React for example. I chose to use Vue for this site due to it's lightweight nature and, of course, to better familiarize myself with the platform!

This is a living site, so expect to see CI/CD updates here as I learn and implement new skills, as well as complete more great projects to add to it!
